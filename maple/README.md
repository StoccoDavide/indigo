# Maple

Welcome in the `maple` folder of the `indigo` project. In this folder, you can find the MAPLE package that can be used for both ODEs/DAEs systems analysis and manipulation. It can also be used to generate efficient MATLAB and C++ code for the integrator available in this repository.

## Dependencies

The MAPLE package depends on the `LULEM` (LU Decomposition with Large Expression Management) package. This package contains functions to solve systems of linear equations with large symbolic expressions. The module uses a pivoting LU decomposition to solve the system of equations.

The `LULEM` package is freely available at this [link](https://github.com/StoccoDavide/LULEM/). For the installation, refer to the instruction present in the repository homepage.

## Installation

To install the package you must have first installed Maple. Then copy the released MLA (Maple Library Archive) file `indigo.mla` in the toolbox folder of Maple installation, which should be:

- OSX: `/Library/Frameworks/Maple.framework/Versions/20XX/toolbox` (susbitutite the `20XX` version with the one you have installed);
- Windows: `C:/Programs/Maple/toolbox/`;
- Linux: `???` (if you managed to install Linux probably you know better than me where is the right folder ğŸ«¡).

If the toolbox folder does not exist, create it.

Then load the library in a Maple worksheet or document by typing:
```
> with(indigo);
```
If the package is loaded without errors, it is done!
