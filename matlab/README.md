# Matlab

Welcome in the `matlab` folder of the `indigo` project. In this folder, you can find the Matlab version of the software. This folder is mainly used by the authors for prototyping and testing the algorithms. Still, it is fully maintained and it can be useful to those programmers that want to peek between the code lines.

## Dependencies

The Matlab library version has no third-party dependencies.

## Installation

Currently we do not have a Matlab toolbox for the Matlab version of the `indigo` project. You can run the `setup.m` to include all the needed files in the current Matlab paths.

## Usage

Please refer to the online [documentation](https://StoccoDavide.github.io/indigo/).
